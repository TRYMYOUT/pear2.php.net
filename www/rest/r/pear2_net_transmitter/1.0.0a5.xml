 <s>Wrapper for network stream functionality.</s>
 <d>PHP has built in support for various types of network streams, such as HTTP and TCP sockets. One problem that arises with them is the fact that a single fread/fwrite call might not read/write all the data you intended, regardless of whether you're in blocking mode or not. While the PHP manual offers a workaround in the form of a loop with a few variables, using it every single time you want to read/write can be tedious.

This package abstracts this away, so that when you want to get exactly N amount of bytes, you can be sure the upper levels of your app will be dealing with N bytes. Oh, and the functionality is nicely wrapped in an object (but that's just the icing on the cake).</d>

 <n>* Added fragments to exceptions, allowing retrieval of incomplete receives' contents, and byte count on incomplete sends.
* Changed Stream to use an fread/fwrite duo instead of stream_copy_to_stream() for the sake of stability.
* Tweaked Stream::isAcceptingData() and NetworkStream::isAvailable(), in order to work around a reproducible hang on Linux.
* Doc fixes.</n>
